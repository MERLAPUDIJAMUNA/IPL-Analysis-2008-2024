# IPL-Analysis-2008-2024
Power BI Dashboard analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 to 2024, featuring team stats, player performance, match trends, and more.

# Project Overview
* In this project, we collected, cleaned, and analyzed IPL match data from various sources to identify key trends and patterns.  
* We developed visualizations and interactive dashboards using Power BI to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.  
* Additionally, we performed statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to validate our findings and enhance data-driven decision-making.
  
# Key Achievements
* Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered IPL match data from Kaggle and other sources. Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query Editor in Power BI
* Data Analysis: Performed statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to uncover hidden insights and validate business decisions.
* Visualizations & Dashboards: Designed interactive and insightful dashboards using Power BI to showcase team performance, player stats, match outcomes, and trends.
* Data Quality Improvement: Detected and addressed inconsistencies in the raw data, and applied automation techniques for smoother data processing.
* Presentation: Delivered insights through well-structured visuals, catering to both technical and non-technical audiences for better decision-making.
  
# Dataset Information
* IPL_Matches.csv: Match-level data.
* IPL_Deliveries.zip: Delivery-level data (zipped due to GitHub's file size limit).
⚠️ Please unzip `IPL_Deliveries.zip` before using in Power BI.
